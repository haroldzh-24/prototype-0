## Unreleased

### Mobile Stage Model Foundation - 2026-09-09

- Added a versioned StageDocument with one ordered collection of target, wall, and start objects.
- Centralized fresh defaults and ID-based movement; added explicit document/viewport coordinate types with identity conversion in legacy layout units.
- Migrated the mobile editor to shared document state and dragging while retaining styles, positions, dimensions, drawing order, add/remove/reset semantics, and minimum-only bounds checks.
- Physical coordinates and stable ID allocation remain proposed follow-up work; no persistence or new editor features added.
- Validation: TypeScript passed; Expo Android/iOS/web export passed (Hermes required execution outside the sandbox); inline regression checks passed for defaults, reset isolation, coordinate round trips, movement/clamping, 500 legacy add/remove comparisons, and unchanged styles. On-device gestures were not manually tested.

### Added

- A responsive 2D stage-planning area.
- Three labeled shooting-position blocks with mouse, touch, and pen dragging.
- Boundary checks that keep position blocks inside the stage.
- A button that returns all blocks to their starting positions.
- Simple, clean styling with a stage grid and clear drag states.
- Three draggable, cardboard-shaped target markers.
- Three draggable wall objects in horizontal and vertical orientations.
- Controls for adding and removing targets and walls during a session.
- Unique internal IDs for dynamically created targets and walls.

### Changed

- Added future stage-planning ideas to `features.md`.
- Extended boundary checking and reset behavior to targets and walls.
- Simplified the stage to one draggable block labeled `Start Position`.
- Reset now removes added objects, restores removed defaults, and returns every default object to its starting location.
- Reused the shared drag behavior for both default and newly created objects.

### Fixed

- Nothing yet.
